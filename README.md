# Svelte Todo

A todo app created with Svelte, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS to explore Svelte as a framework. Users can create a list of todos and toggle them between 'done' and 'not done' states. Done todos always appear at the bottom of the list and most recently modified todos appear at the top. Todos are cached in Local Storage.
